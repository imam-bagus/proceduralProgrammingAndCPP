Program furniture company for compute price of any table a customer order, based fact
        - charge for all tables is a minimum of $150.00.
        - if surface (length x width) over 750 square inches, add & 50.00.
        - if wood is mahogany, add $200.000; if oak add $100.00; No charge is added for pine
        - For extension leaves for table, there is an additional $50.00 charge each.

input: 
        - costTable (initialized to 0.00) (sample input 150.00)
        - lengthTable (initialized to 50 inches)
        - widthTable (initialized to 40 inches)
        - surfaceAreaOfTable
        - woodType (initialized with value "oak")
        - extensionLeaves (initialized with value 2)

Output:
        - (Sample Output) Print "The charge for this table is $400"
        - Print "The charge for this table is $", costTable
